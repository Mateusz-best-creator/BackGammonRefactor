# C_Backgammon

This repository houses all the files for my university Backgammon project, coded entirely in C++. While the primary language is C++, certain features, such as file opening and constant definition, adhere to C conventions using #define instead of const.

### Database
Manage your player database with the ability to add and delete players. The player's points are visible in the Hall of Fame.

### AI Bots
Engage in games with two AI bots, each employing distinct playing strategies. Alternatively, let them face off against each other.

### Saving Each State of the Game & Visualizing
Every game state is meticulously saved to a file. After completing a game, delve into visualization mode to review each state from inception to conclusion. Navigate forward or backward one state at a time, empowering you to conduct thorough game analyses.

### Saving File Format
